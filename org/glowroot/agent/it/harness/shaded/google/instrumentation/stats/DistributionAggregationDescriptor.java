/**
 * Describes data aggregations based on distributions.

 * <p>A distribution aggregation may optionally contain a histogram of the values in the
 * population. The bucket boundaries for that histogram are described by
 * {@link BucketBoundaries}, which defines {@code BucketBoundaries.getBoundaries.size() + 1 (= N)}
 * buckets. The boundaries for bucket index i are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>[-infinity, bounds[i]) for i == 0
 * <li>[bounds[i-1], bounds[i]) for 0 &lt; i &lt; N-1
 * <li>[bounds[i-1], +infinity) for i == N-1
 * </ul>
 * i.e. an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (1 through N - 2, and an
 * overflow bucket (N - 1), with inclusive lower bounds and exclusive upper bounds.
 *
 * <p>Note: If N = 1, there are no finite buckets and the single bucket is both the overflow
 * and underflow bucket.
